# Salient Brand Guidelines (Condensed Reference)

Use this reference for all brand-design outputs.

## 1) Brand Positioning and Voice

### Core Brand Pillars
- Compliance-First — Federal & state regulation
- Workflow Automation — Full documentation
- Borrower Memory — Historical context
- Complete Lifecycle — Origination through payoff

### Preferred Messaging
Use specific, exam-ready language:
- "Compliance-first AI"
- "AI agents built for US consumer lenders"
- "Built for how lenders are examined"
- "50% cost reduction" (only when specific and supportable)
- "TCPA, FCRA, FDCPA, GLBA, UDAAP"
- "PCI Level 1", "SOC 2"
- "Full audit trail"

### Avoid Messaging
- "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "transform overnight"
- Generic AI buzzwords
- "AI-powered" alone (without specifics)
- Overpromising results
- Making it about us (lead with customer outcomes, not company)
- Unspecific compliance claims

### Tone in Practice
- **On-brand**: "Salient automates collections and disputes with compliance-first AI — built for how US lenders are supervised and examined."
  - Specific. Grounded in the customer's reality. Leads with benefit.
- **Off-brand**: "Our revolutionary AI platform transforms the way financial institutions operate."
  - Vague. Lender-focused industries distrust hype. Be precise.

## 2) Color System

### Palette
- Main Cream: `#FAF6F2` (about 80% of layouts)
- Secondary Cream: `#F6F0E9` (cards, sections, deep-dive areas)
- Charcoal: `#0F0F0F` (impact moments, transitions)
- Gold: `#C9A962` (accents, CTAs, numbered circles, borders, highlights)
- Positive/Negative indicators: `#34C759` / `#FF3B30`

### Usage Strategy
- Workhorse Light: Main Cream (~80%)
- Impact Secondary: Secondary Cream (~15%)
- Momentum Dark: Charcoal (~5%)
- Use Gold sparingly to signal action and priority.

## 3) Typography System

### Display Typeface: Halant
- Use for headlines and display copy only.
- Keep headlines tall and tight.
- Target line-height: `0.9-0.95`.
- Never use Halant for body copy.

### Body and UI Typeface: Geist / System
- Default body size: `14-16px`.
- Minimum: `12px`.
- For presentations: never below 12pt.

## 4) Component and Visual Language Rules

### Buttons
- Primary CTA style: Gold.
- Pill shape with very rounded corners (100px feel).

### Badges
- Include a feature/category badge consistently across slides when building decks.

### Metrics
- Positive metrics: green `#34C759`, prefix with `+`.
- Negative metrics: red `#FF3B30`, prefix with `−`.
- Keep metric displays large, bold, and scannable.

### Icons
- Prefer bold filled icons.
- White icons on dark charcoal surfaces (`#1A1A1A`) for dark moments.

### Visual Language
- Warm radial glows
- Floating elements
- Gold/amber gradients
- Particle dots
- Rounded geometric forms
- Subtle grid patterns

### Dark Mode Constraints
- Glassmorphism is dark-only.
- Do not use glass effects on cream backgrounds.

## 5) Layout and Slide Rules

### General Layout
- Safe zone: 5% even on all edges.
- Feature split: 70/30 visual-to-benefit.
- Corner radius: 24px consistent curves.
- Negative space = premium. If a slide feels busy, increase padding between title and body.

### Slide Color Strategy
- ~80% Workhorse (Light): Main Cream — body slides, readable and fresh.
- ~15% Impact (Secondary): Secondary Cream — data-heavy or deep-dive sections.
- ~5% Momentum (Dark): Charcoal — transition slides and "The Big Ask."
- Accents: Gold `#C9A962` for CTAs, numbered circles, borders, highlights.

### Slide Type Matrix
| Slide Type | Layout | Typography | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Title | Centered | Halant 120pt | High-impact opening |
| Transition | Dark Mode | Halant 80pt | Reset before new topic |
| Data / ROI | 3-Column Grid | Geist Bold labels | Prove value with numbers |
| Feature | 70/30 Split | Halant 60pt + Geist | Explain product capabilities |
| Process | Vertical Timeline | Geist 14pt | "How it works" clearly |
| Closing | Centered + Contact | Halant 60pt | Memorable finish with CTA |

### Slide Design Rules
- Badge on every slide — acts as breadcrumb so the audience always knows where they are.
- Halant: tall and tight — line-height 0.9 on headlines; never compress below this.
- Negative space = premium — if a slide feels busy, increase padding between title and body.
- No glassmorphism on cream — glass effects only on Charcoal; muddy on cream backgrounds.

## 6) Practical Implementation Checklist

Before finalizing any artifact:
1. Confirm typography assignment (Halant vs Geist/system) is correct.
2. Confirm palette usage and distribution.
3. Confirm copy tone is specific, compliance-aware, and non-hype.
4. Confirm layout spacing and safe zones.
5. Confirm component style consistency (badges, CTA, icons, metric states).
