# Brand Design

This skill translates Salient's brand rules into concrete output decisions for slides, web pages, one-pagers, sales collateral, and copy edits. Prioritize precision and consistency over novelty.

Read `references/salient-brand-guidelines.md` before generating or revising deliverables.
If exact wording/layout evidence is needed, consult `references/salient-brand-guidelines-source.pdf`.

## Workflow

1. Identify output type and medium (slide deck, web section, landing page, doc, ad, email, etc.).
2. Map brand rules from the reference file into a delivery checklist for that medium.
3. Generate or revise content/design with strict adherence to color, typography, voice, and component constraints.
4. Run a final brand QA pass and explicitly list any intentional deviations.

## Design Direction

Use bold, intentional visual direction, but keep it grounded in Salient's regulated-finance context.

- Commit to one coherent aesthetic per artifact.
- Favor high-contrast hierarchy, clean spacing, and premium restraint.
- Use visual emphasis intentionally (dark impact moments, gold accents) instead of decoration.
- Avoid generic startup-AI design tropes and buzzword-heavy visual metaphors.

## Copy and Messaging Rules

When writing or editing copy:

- Lead with concrete outcomes and compliance credibility.
- Use specific terms (for example: TCPA, FCRA, FDCPA, GLBA, UDAAP, PCI Level 1, SOC 2, audit trail).
- Keep language customer-centered and operationally grounded.
- Remove hype words, vague claims, and unspecific compliance statements.

## Required QA Before Finalizing

Validate every output against these checks:

1. Typography: Halant only for display/headlines; Geist/system for body and UI.
2. Color: Palette usage follows recommended distribution and role.
3. Voice: Claims are specific, compliant, and non-hype.
4. Layout: Safe margins, readable spacing, and purposeful hierarchy.
5. Components: Badges, CTAs, icons, and dark-mode effects follow the guidance rules.

If any rule is violated, fix it before delivering.
